# Resturand Database Management System
As competition within the restaurant industry increases and customer expectations continue to rise, there
is a growing need for technology to control customer flow, staff operations, orders, and payments with
precision. However, coordinating reservations, walk-ins, table assignments, orders, and payments can be
challenging without a robust database management system (DBMS).
Our Restaurant Database Management System (RDBM) focuses on a full-service restaurant environment
in which customers interact with the business through channels (walk-ins, reservations, or waitlist).
Employees manage visits, take orders, serve items, and process payments. The database must support
these interactions while enforcing business rules that maintain data integrity.
This system also standardizes operational processes across branches, enabling management to monitor
performance, track employee activity, analyze sales, and deliver customer experiences.
